# Shoplytics

## **Project Objective**
The goal of **Shoplytics** is to develop an end-to-end data pipeline for an e-commerce platform. The pipeline enables the ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis of transactional data. The entire project is designed to run locally and leverages modern technologies to efficiently transform and analyze data

---

## **Scenario**
An e-commerce platform generates a variety of transactional data daily, including:
- **Orders**: Product sales, purchase amounts, customer details
- **Products**: Categories, prices, availability
- **Regions**: Sales by country, city, or store

The platform aims to analyze this data to:
1. Identify regional sales trends
2. Understand product trends and performance
3. Provide reports and dashboards for business decisions

---

## **Challenges**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Integration of batch and streaming data sources
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Transformation of large datasets into an analyzable format
3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Building an efficient structure for aggregated reporting
4. **Automation**:
   - Automating data pipelines for reproducibility

---

## **Goals**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Batch processing from CSV files
   - Streaming simulation with Apache Kafka
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Transformation and aggregation using Python and Apache Spark
3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Creating a star schema for analytical reporting
4. **Automation**:
   - Workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow
5. **Analysis**:
   - Building interactive dashboards with Streamlit
6. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitoring the pipeline using Prometheus and Grafana

---

## **Target Audience**
This project is aimed at:
- **Data Engineers**: Who want to develop end-to-end data pipelines
- **Data Scientists**: Who need prepared data for their analyses
- **Developers**: Who wish to understand and reproduce modern data infrastructure

---

## **Summary**
**Shoplytics simulates a complete data pipeline that efficiently processes e-commerce data from ingestion to analysis. The solution is fully locally executable and uses modern technologies to provide aggregated data models and interactive reports**
